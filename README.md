# Ayane
**Ayane** is a simple and intuitive Command Line Interface (CLI) application for managing your daily tasks. It allows you to quickly `add`, `list`, `mark` as `complete`, `edit`, and `delete` your to-do tesk directly from your terminal.

## Features
- **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks to your list.
- **List Tasks:** View all your tasks, showing their status (completed/incomplete).
- **Mark Tasks as Complete:** Mark tasks as done, including a completion timestamp.
- **Edit Tasks:** Modify the description of existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from your list.
- **Persistent Storage:** All tasks are saved to a local `JSON` file, so your list persists across sessions.

## Installation
To install the Ayane CLI, you need to have [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (version 1.18 or higher) installed on your system.
